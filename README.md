# blackHair-Multiclass-Classification-CNN
An implementation of a CNN that uses Tensorflow to classify 9 types of Black hair patterns. Inspired by  Nicholas Renotte's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&amp;pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIGNyZWF0ZSBhIENOTiBpbiBweXRob24%3D&amp;ab_channel=NicholasRenotte. Trained using a dataset I currated with 800 or so images of different Black hair patterns: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hearthoya/blackhairv2. Using opencv-python, tensorflow, os, and a few other packages.
