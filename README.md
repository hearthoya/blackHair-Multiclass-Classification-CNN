# blackHair-Multiclass-Classification-CNN
An implementation of a CNN that uses Tensorflow to classify 9 types of Black hair patterns. Inspired by  Nicholas Renotte's video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jztwpsIzEGc&amp;pp=ygUdaG93IHRvIGNyZWF0ZSBhIENOTiBpbiBweXRob24%3D&amp;ab_channel=NicholasRenotte. Trained using a dataset I currated with 800 or so images of different Black hair patterns: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hearthoya/blackhairv2. Using opencv-python, tensorflow, os, and a few other packages. In the root folder create folders titled logs and models as locations to store test logs and models. In the logs folder, create two sub folders called training and validation in order to store logs of your model if you wish to.
